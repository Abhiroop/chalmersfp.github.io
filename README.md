# FP-homepage sources

+ The page sources are in FP-group/ 
+ To "build" the static site use
make
+ The generated pages are saved in docs/ where you can check that they work as intended.
+ Then git add + commit + push. (Note that you need to git add both the source files and the generated html files.)
+ Finally, the github pages automation places the docs/ contents at https://chalmersfp.github.io/

(TODO: Automate the build + add + commit + push steps)
