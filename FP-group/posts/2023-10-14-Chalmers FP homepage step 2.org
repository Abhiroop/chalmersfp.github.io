#+TITLE: Chalmers FP homepage, step 2
#+AUTHOR: Patrik Jansson

After this initial draft, with some minimal information about the FP unit professors added, it is now time to broaden it to cover at least the FP unit.
Many TODOs remain:

+ adding more members,
+ adding pictures,
+ integrating the FP-talk series,
+ publication lists,
+ better formatting / style / layout,
+ [your own idea here;-]
+ etc.

Input, and help, is highly appreciated.
