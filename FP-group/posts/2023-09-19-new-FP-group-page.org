* New Chalmers FP group page

The Chalmers (and UGOT) Functional Programming group has not been very good at keeping a homepage alive. There was [[https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/FP/FP][a wiki]] until around 2016, but not much after that. I (Patrik) have now been following the [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials/01-installation.html][Hakyll tutorial]] to set up a bare minimum new page that we can improve over time.
