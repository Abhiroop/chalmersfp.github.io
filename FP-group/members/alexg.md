I am a Senior Lecturer (Universitetslektor) at the  University of Gothenburg and
Chalmers in Sweden. I am a member of the Functional Programming unit in the
department of Computer Science and Engineering. I am the head of the bachelor
Computer Science programme (Datavetenskapligt program). My research interest are
functional programming languages, property-based testing, and how we can use
software technology to improve education.
