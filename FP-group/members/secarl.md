Carl has had a career in both academia (Wateloo, Carnegie Mellon University, University of British Columbia, Oxford, Chalmers) and industry (21 years at Intel corp.).
He stands with one leg in hardware and one leg in software and his research bridges the two. He is the creator, and maintainer, of the Voss/Forte/Voss II formal hardware verification system (see https://github.com/TeamVoss/VossII) and is interested in how to quickly design correct low-power HW/SW systems.
